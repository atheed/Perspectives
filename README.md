# Perspectives
Have you ever been reading something on the internet about a particular issue, and just craved another article/piece surrounding that same issue, to give you perspective? Well, wait no longer! 

Use Perspectives while on any page on the internet -- simply click the "P" button on the Chrome extensions bar in your browser, on the top-right of the window -- and instantly get a list of 10 other articles about the same issues/topics/areas as the one you're reading. Never yearn for more context on any topic ever again!
